1. Authentication Overview
All requests made to the API must be authenticated before access to any protected resource is granted. Authentication ensures that the requesting client or user has a verified identity. Requests that fail authentication checks shall be denied immediately to protect system integrity and user data.

2. API Key Authentication
Clients may authenticate using a unique API key issued by the system. The key must be transmitted in the HTTP Authorization header using the format "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>". Keys must remain confidential and must not be embedded in client-side code or shared publicly.

3. Secure Transport
All traffic between clients and servers must occur over HTTPS. Plain HTTP connections are not permitted. TLS encryption protects credentials and sensitive information from interception during transmission.

4. Credential Storage
API keys, passwords, and tokens must be stored securely using encrypted storage or environment variables. Hardcoding credentials in source code is strictly prohibited.

5. Token Expiration
Authentication tokens shall include an expiration time. Once expired, the token becomes invalid and the client must reauthenticate to obtain a new token.

6. Session Management
Authenticated sessions are maintained using secure tokens. The server validates each request independently, ensuring stateless and scalable session handling.

7. Password Policy
Passwords must be at least eight characters long and include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Weak passwords will be rejected to reduce the risk of compromise.

8. Account Lockout
If multiple consecutive login attempts fail, the system may temporarily lock the account to prevent brute-force attacks. Locked accounts may be unlocked after a cooling period or through support.

9. Multi-Factor Authentication
For enhanced security, multi-factor authentication may be required. Users must provide an additional verification method such as a one-time code or authenticator application.

10. OAuth 2.0 Overview
The API supports OAuth 2.0 to allow third-party applications to access user data without exposing passwords. OAuth enables delegated authorization and improves overall security practices.

11. Authorization Code Flow
The authorization code grant is recommended for server-side applications. The user authenticates through a secure consent screen, and the client exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

12. Client Credentials Flow
Machine-to-machine services may authenticate using client credentials. This flow allows backend systems to interact securely without user involvement.

13. Refresh Tokens
Refresh tokens allow clients to request new access tokens after expiration without requiring the user to log in again. Refresh tokens must be stored securely and rotated periodically.

14. Scope-Based Access
Each token includes defined scopes that limit what operations the client may perform. Requests outside the permitted scope shall be rejected with a forbidden response.

15. JWT Tokens
Access tokens may be issued as JSON Web Tokens. JWTs contain encoded claims about the user and are signed to ensure authenticity.

16. JWT Claims
Tokens may include claims such as user ID, role, permissions, and expiration time. These claims allow efficient authorization without additional database queries.

17. Token Verification
Every request containing a token must be validated by verifying the signature and expiration timestamp. Invalid tokens are rejected immediately.

18. Rate Limiting
To ensure system stability and fair usage, clients are limited to one hundred requests per minute. Excessive usage may result in throttling or temporary suspension.

19. Error Handling
All errors shall follow a standardized JSON structure that includes an error code, message, and details. This ensures predictable behavior for client applications.
